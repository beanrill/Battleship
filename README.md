# Battleship

A battleship game on a 10x10 grid that involves two players. Both players will place their ships on the
board. Each player's turn involves a placemen of a torpedo anywhere on the board. If it strikes the
opposing player's ship, it will be marked on the board as struck, otherwise any other hit would be a
miss. Once a player has hit all possible strikes on a ship then the ship has 'sunk'. A player wins
by hitting every ship on the opponent's board.
